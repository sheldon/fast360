A javascript &amp; flash implementation of a 360 degree rotator using normal turntable-style photography.

You can clone this git repo, or download from http://github.com/sheldon/fast360/zipball/master and uncompress, onto a webserver for a fully working example. The included swf file should work for any size images, just be sure to make the object tag in html 100% width and height. Otherwise if you want to modify the swf for a custom preloader or the actionscript, help yourself.
